presidents_military_conflicts_initiated.xlsx

The data was taken from Wikipedia listing every war and military conlfict that
involved the US in the 20th and 21st century. I manually entered the data into 
an excel sheet, with the first president that had an involvement in the conflict
being the one to start it (first year of war starting under whose presidency).
