average_crime.xlsx

This data came from FBI Crime Data Explorer. The information uses custom query
results that were set to: January, 1985 - December 2024, All Violent Crimes,
All Property Crimes, United States. I manually put the data onto an excel sheet,
with the values being the mean of the crime for each year rounded to no decimal
places.
